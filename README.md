# Amazon Price Tracker

## Overview
This Python script tracks the price of a specific product on Amazon and sends an email alert if the price drops below a specified target.

## Features
- Fetches the current price and title of the product from Amazon using web scraping with BeautifulSoup.
- Compares the fetched price with a target price and sends an email notification if the current price drops below the target.
- Uses `requests` for HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `smtplib` for sending email alerts.

## Setup
To use this script:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your email credentials:
   ```
   MY_EMAIL=<your-email>
   PASSWORD=<your-password>
   ```
4. Update the `url` variable with the Amazon product URL you want to track.
5. Set the `target_price` variable to the desired price threshold.
6. Run the script:
   ```
   python amazon_price_tracker.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `BeautifulSoup` library
- `python-dotenv` library
- Access to an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail) to send email notifications

## Notes
- Ensure your email provider allows programmatic access (e.g., for Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" or set up an App Password).
- The script assumes the Amazon product page structure remains consistent. Any changes in Amazon's HTML structure may require updating the script accordingly.
